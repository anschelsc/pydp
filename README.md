pydp
====

pydp is an implementation of
[Dissociated Press](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociated_press) written in
python3.

At the moment all options are controlled by four variables at the top of
`pydp.py`

* `bywords` controls whether the program will dissociate by words (`True`) or
  by characters (`False`).
* `overlap` is the minimum number of characters/words of overlap.
* `target` is the number of characters/words to be printed
* `file` is the filename of the sourcefile
