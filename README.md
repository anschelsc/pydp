pydp
====

pydp is an implementation of
[Dissociated Press](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociated_press) written in
python3.

Usage
-----

pydp is controlled by GNU/POSIX-style flags as defined by running
`pydp --help`. If you don't pass it the name of a sourcefile it uses standard
input. To dissociate more than one file, try something like
`cat file1 file2 | pydp`.
